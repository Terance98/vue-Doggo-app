# vue-Doggo-app
This project uses the Dog API to fetch information about all the dog breeds, list them out and gets further information about each breed when clicked. Check out the app live at https://doggo20.herokuapp.com


## Starting up the clinet 
Go to the doggo-client folder and run "npm install" in the terminal. Then run "npm run server" to run it locally or "npm run build" to build the production app and then "node server.js" to run the app.

## The APIs
In the doggo-server folder lies the authenticaion and verification APIs. There is a local version of the api as well as seperate APIs as three lambda functions.
